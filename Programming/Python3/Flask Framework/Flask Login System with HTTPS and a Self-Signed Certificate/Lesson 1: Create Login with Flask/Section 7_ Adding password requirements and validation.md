To make your application more secure, you can add password requirements and validation. For example, you can require that passwords contain a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.

To do this, you'll need to add validation code to the `login` function. Here's an example:

```
from flask import render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        
        # Check if the username and password are valid
        if username == 'admin' and validate_password(password):
            # Set the session variable to indicate that the user is logged in
            session['logged_in'] = True
            
            # Redirect the user to the dashboard page
            return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
        else:
            # If the username or password is incorrect, display an error message
            error = 'Invalid credentials. Please try again.'
            return render_template('login.html', error=error)
    
    # If the request method is GET, render the login page
    return render_template('login.html')

def validate_password(password):
    # Check if the password meets the requirements
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
        return False
    if not any(c.islower() for c in password):
        return False
    if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
        return False
    if not any(c in '!@#$%^&*()_-+=[{]}\|;:"<,>.?/' for c in password):
        return False
    
    # If the password meets the requirements, return True
    return True
```


This code defines a `validate_password` function that takes a password as an argument and returns `True` if the password meets the requirements and `False` otherwise. The requirements are that the password must be at least 8 characters long and must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.

In the `login` function, the `validate_password` function is called to check if the user-entered password meets the requirements. If the password is valid and the username is correct, the session variable is set to indicate that the user is logged in and the user is redirected to the dashboard page. If the password is invalid or the username is incorrect, an error message is displayed.
