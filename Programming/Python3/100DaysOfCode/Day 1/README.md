# Goals  

## Lessons
### Printing  
Printing is done with the print command  
`print ("Hello world!")`  
Printing will remove the `""` when used to print string (text), not code.  
`""` Shows the beginning and the end of a string.  


### Commenting  
```
print ("Hello world!")
# this is a comment
```
This output will be, `Hello world!`
Comments in Python are preceded by a #.  
Comments do not have to be on their own line you can put it after a line of code, it can look nicer to you to do it that way so either way is fine.  

```
print ("Hello world!") # this is a comment
```
This block of code will print, `Hello World!`  
Nothing will follow it. Comments are not shown anywhere expect in the source code.  The output omits coments.

`print("Hello world!\nHello World!")`
This line of codeprints 2 lines. `\n` means to start a new line   
The output is    
```
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

### Debugging  
```
print ("Hello world!)

Error:
  File "main.py", line 2
    print ("Hello world!)
                        ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```
You can solve this error by copying the line, "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal" and paste that into google.  
This error is because there is a missing " between, ! and ).


### Sting Manipulation  


### Variables
