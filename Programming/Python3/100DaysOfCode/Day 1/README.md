# Goals  

## Lessons
### Printing  
* Printing is done with the print command
```
print ("Hello world!")
```
Printing will remove the "" when used to print string (text), not code.  
"" Shows the beginning and the end of a string.  


### Commenting  


### Debugging  
```
print ("Hello world!)

Error:
  File "main.py", line 2
    print ("Hello world!)
                        ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```
You can solve this error by copying the line, "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal" and paste that into google.  
This error is because there is a missing " between, ! and ).


### Sting Manipulation  


### Variables
