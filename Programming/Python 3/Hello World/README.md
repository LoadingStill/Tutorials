To run the above code in PyCharm and see the "Hello, World!" output:  
  
1. Install Python and PyCharm if you haven't already (refer to the previous instructions).
2. Open PyCharm and create a new project.
3. Create a new Python file named hello_world.py inside the project.
4. Copy the code above into the hello_world.py file.
5. Save the file (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S).
6. Right-click anywhere in the code editor.
7. Select "Run 'hello_world'".  
The program will execute, and you should see the output "Hello, World!" in the "Run" tool window at the bottom of the PyCharm interface.  
  
This is a simple starting point for those new to coding, and it demonstrates how to display output in Python. As you progress, you'll learn more about the language and be able to build more complex applications. Happy coding!
