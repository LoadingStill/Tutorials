To validate user input and authenticate users, you'll need to add some additional code to app.py. First, you'll need to import the request object from Flask:

```
from flask import request
```
This will allow you to access the data submitted by the user in the login form. Next, you'll need to modify the login function to handle form submissions and validate the user's input:

```
from flask import render_template, request, redirect, url_for

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        
        # Check if the username and password are valid
        if username == 'admin' and password == 'password':
            # Set the session variable to indicate that the user is logged in
            session['logged_in'] = True
            
            # Redirect the user to the dashboard page
            return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
        else:
            # If the username or password is incorrect, display an error message
            error = 'Invalid credentials. Please try again.'
            return render_template('login.html', error=error)
    
    # If the request method is GET, render the login page
    return render_template('login.html')
```
This code checks if the HTTP request method is `POST`, indicating that the user has submitted the login form. If the request method is `POST`, the code retrieves the values of the `username` and `password` form fields using the `request.form` object.

The code then checks if the username and password are valid. In this example, the username and password are hardcoded to 'admin' and 'password', respectively, but in a real-world application, you would need to validate the user's input against a database or other authentication mechanism.

If the username and password are valid, the code sets a session variable to indicate that the user is logged in and redirects the user to the dashboard page. If the username or password is incorrect, the code displays an error message on the login page.
