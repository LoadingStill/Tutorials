# Connect To an NFS Share

## Debian Based Distros:
First always update your system before you install packages.  This will make sure you do not have conflicts with your operating system.  I will be using nano in this guide but any text edditor will work.


### Packages to Install:
`nfs-common`


### Commands:
`sudo apt install nfs-common`

### Files To Edit:
`/etc/fstab`

In the fstab file you want to add a line at the very bottom of the file and add the following.

Server IP:/shared/file   tab   location on your system   tab     share protocol    tab    this is the the settings on the connection (try this)
|---------------------|_______|-----------------------|________|----------------|_______|------------------------------------------------------|
host_ip:/var/nfs/general            /nfs/general                       nfs                auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0



## Arch Based Distros:
