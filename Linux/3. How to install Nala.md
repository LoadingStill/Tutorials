# Goals:
Install and be able to use nala.  As well, alias apt to nala.


# Requirements:
* Your Linux distro must use apt for nala to function.
* text editor - I will be using nano in this guide


# Commands:
* `sudo apt install nala` #install nala (this only works if nala is in your distros package repository)
* `nano /file/path/here #opens the file in nano

# Guide:
1. First, let's test if your distro has nala in the repos.  In the terminal, type `sudo apt install nala` if this comes back with a package installed, then skip to step 3.
2. If nala is not in your repo, then we will add the source repo.
    1. `echo "deb-src https://deb.volian.org/volian/ scar main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/volian-archive-scar-unstable.list`
    2. `sudo apt install nala`
3. Now that nala is installed, you can use nala as follows
    1. `sudo nala install packageName`
4. If you prefer to alias nala to apt so that you can always use nala then we will need to edit the .bashrc files.
    1. `sudo nano /.bashrc`
    2. paste the following code
        1. `alias sudo='sudo '` #this makes it so the sudo bug when using sudo with an alias works.
        2. `alias nala='apt'` #makes apt alias to nala
        3. `alias nala='apt-get'` #makes apt-get alias to nala
    3. Now hit `Ctrl + S` to save
    4. Now hit `Ctrl + X` to exit nano
5. COMPLETE! :D
