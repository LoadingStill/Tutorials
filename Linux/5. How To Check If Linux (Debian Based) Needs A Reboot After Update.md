#Save this script as a file (e.g. `update_and_reboot_check.sh`) and make it executable with `chmod +x update_and_reboot_check.sh`.
#Then run it with `./update_and_reboot_check.sh` from a terminal.

#The script updates the package lists and upgrades any installed packages using `apt-get`.
#It then checks for the presence of the `/var/run/reboot-required` file,
#which is created by some updates to indicate that a reboot is required to complete the update process.
#If the file exists, the script prompts the user to reboot or wait, and reboots if the user chooses to do so.
#If the file does not exist, the script informs the user that no reboot is required.
